# JetsProject

# Description
The purpose of this project was to create an ArrayList<>(); that would store Jet Objects that were created in a seperate jets.txt file. The User would then be provided with several options involving the listing each Jet, to comparing top speeds and ranges. The User also has the ability to add or remove Jet objects from the ArrayList<>();. However the crux of the project was the use of interafaces and overridden methods that allowed for seperate classes that extend the abstract Jet class to utilize the same method with different results, or have access to their own methods entirely. The user will be presented with the menu and its options until opting to quit the application.
# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Skill Distillery TAs, SD37 Cohort
# Lessons Learned
This project helped demonstrate the styntax and functionality of interfaces. It also heavily reinforced the utility and necessity of the @Override Eclipse funtion in order to create variability in results of the same method call on different classes of Jet objects. This project was admittedly more abstract... (get it?) and harder for me to grasp than previous, but with more practice I believe I'll get the hang of it.
